## Creation Date
2026-01-11

## Skill Type
Project Assessment Skill

## Purpose
Assesses overall project readiness for submission/deployment by validating completion criteria, runtime reliability, documentation quality, and identifying risks.

## Key Functions
1. Phase completion validation
2. Application runtime verification
3. Demo reliability assessment
4. Documentation quality review
5. Risk identification and blocking issue detection
